# python_kings_journey
This repository is for my final project in the subject CMSC 12 which dealt with Python.

The game is similar to a knights journey where you try to make the piece travel in all
the squares without getting trapped by your previous move. This game contains one solution
and uses the random module to show different numbers per game trial. It also uses the os
module to clear the board and the time module to input delay in the UI of the game. Since there
are problems rising when copying a save state, this console game also makes use of the deepcopy
function in the copy module to remedy the save state problems.

## Learnings
- how to load and save data in python
- how to import and use modules in python
- how to delay code using time module in UI
- how to copy save and load states using deep copy
- how to randomize values using the random module


## Recommendations
- add more templates of the games and randomize it per play
- add highlights to where the king is currently placed
